Blacklisting annoying phone numbers

Simple CSV list of phone numbers I blacklisted because of spam or scam.
PR accepted, please separate spams from scams, and use international number format when applicable, or add [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) to 4-digit numbers.

To block these numbers:
- add them to your local phone blacklist
- add them to your phone company's incoming call filters:
